# 🚖 Smart Ride Matching System

## 🔥 Overview
Smart Ride Matching System is an intelligent ride-matching platform that efficiently connects riders with the nearest available drivers based on real-time location data and road network constraints. The system leverages **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute the shortest driving distance between riders and drivers, ensuring optimal ride allocation.

Features:

✔️ Intelligent driver-rider matching
✔️ Haversine Formula for accurate distance calculation
✔️ Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest route selection
✔️ MySQL database for ride and driver management
✔️ Real-time ride status tracking

Tech Stack:

🔹 Java – Core logic and ride-matching algorithms
🔹 MySQL – Database for ride history and driver details
🔹 JDBC – SQL connectivity for seamless data retrieval
🔹 Graph Algorithms – Optimized route calculation
🔹 GitHub – Version control and collaboration

How It Works:

A rider requests a ride.
The system retrieves available drivers.
It calculates the shortest driving distance using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
The most optimal driver is assigned.
The ride status is updated in the database.
The ride progresses to completion.

Future Enhancements:

🚀 Real-time GPS tracking for accurate location updates
🚀 Dynamic pricing model based on demand & supply
🚀 Multi-rider pooling for cost-efficient rides
🚀 Mobile app integration for a seamless user experience
